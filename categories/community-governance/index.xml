The proposals are then put to the community for broader discussion, getting opinions and suggestions from all parties involved before forming final conclusions.
Details # Anyone can submit an NEP. The Newton Foundation is responsible for assigning an exclusive number to each.</description></item><item><title>NewChain MainNet Opening</title><link>https://nepdemo.newton.bio/neps/nep-27/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nepdemo.newton.bio/neps/nep-27/</guid><description>Simple Summary # After NewChain TestNet successful opening, NewChain MainNet is going to be opened by inviting the community to setup, run and maintain the ledger nodes.
Abstract # In current stage, NewChain MainNet would still run with PoA (Proof-of-Authority) consensus mechanism for producing blocks. Hence a certain amount of staking would be required for keeping the ledger nodes honest and not be malicious to harm the network.</description></item><item><title>NewPay Community Node Migration</title><link>https://nepdemo.newton.bio/neps/nep-29/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nepdemo.newton.bio/neps/nep-29/</guid><description>Simple Summary # As part of the NewChain MainNet opening strategy and upgrading plan, the current &amp;ldquo;community nodes&amp;rdquo; in NewPay for virtual mining would be migrated and resolved for paving the way of NewChain to embrace a more bright future.
This proposal will illustrate a possible solution for migrating them to be integrated into the NewSwap mining framework to also benefit the development of NewSwap.
Abstract # The current &amp;ldquo;community nodes&amp;rdquo; in NewPay are doing &amp;ldquo;virtual mining&amp;rdquo; nowadays for daily released NEW from NewPool.</description></item></channel></rss>
